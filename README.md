Fruit Freshness Detection for Conveyor Belt Automation
## **Fruit Freshness Detection for Conveyor Belt Automation**  

### **Project Overview**  
This project implements an **automated fruit freshness detection system** designed for a **conveyor belt**. Using a **camera**, the system captures images of fruits and classifies them as **fresh or rotten**. Based on the classification, a **motor** will rotate accordingly to sort the fruits.  

### **Key Features**  
 **Camera-Based Detection**: Captures fruit images for analysis.  
 **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a trained neural network to classify freshness.  
 **Real-Time Processing**: Detects freshness instantly as fruits move on the conveyor belt.  
 **Motor Control**: Rotates the motor to sort fresh and rotten fruits.  
 **Automation Ready**: Ideal for industrial and agricultural sorting systems.  

### **Technology Stack**  
ðŸ”¹ Python, OpenCV, PyTorch (or TensorFlow)  
ðŸ”¹ Raspberry Pi / Arduino (for motor control)  
ðŸ”¹ Conveyor Belt Mechanism  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Image Capture**: The camera captures images of fruits on the conveyor belt.  
2. **Freshness Classification**: The model predicts whether the fruit is fresh or rotten.  
3. **Motor Activation**:  
   - If **fresh**, the motor directs it to the **"Fresh"** section.  
   - If **rotten**, it is diverted to the **"Reject"** section.  
4. **Repeat** for continuous sorting.  

### **Future Enhancements**  
ðŸ”¸ Multi-fruit classification (Apple, Banana, etc.)  
ðŸ”¸ Integration with IoT for remote monitoring  
ðŸ”¸ Improved accuracy with a larger dataset
