# **Automated Fruit Freshness Detection & Sorting System for Conveyor Belts**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project is an **AI-powered fruit freshness detection and sorting system** designed for **conveyor belt automation**. The system integrates **YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection**, **ROS (Robot Operating System) for real-time processing**, and **sensor-based expiry date detection** to classify and sort fruits based on their freshness. The goal is to automate quality control in **food processing industries, warehouses, and agricultural setups**.  

## **Key Features**  
 **YOLO-based Object Detection**: Accurately detects and classifies fruits on the conveyor.  
 **Freshness Classification**: Uses a deep learning model to determine if a fruit is fresh or rotten.  
 **Expiry Date Detection**: Integrates sensors (such as **gas sensors** for ethylene detection or **RFID scanners**) to determine shelf life.  
 **ROS Integration**: Enables real-time communication between the camera, detection system, and motor controllers.  
 **Motorized Sorting Mechanism**: Automatically rotates the motor to divert fruits based on classification.  
 **IoT Connectivity (Future Scope)**: Allows remote monitoring and data logging.  

## **Technology Stack**  
ðŸ”¹ **Deep Learning & Computer Vision**: YOLOv8, OpenCV, PyTorch  
ðŸ”¹ **Embedded Systems & Sensors**: Raspberry Pi / Arduino, RFID sensors, Gas Sensors (for spoilage detection)  
ðŸ”¹ **ROS for Real-Time Processing**: Communication between camera, sensors, and motors  
ðŸ”¹ **Motor Control**: Servo/Motor driver for conveyor belt sorting  
ðŸ”¹ **Cloud & IoT (Future Enhancement)**: Remote monitoring and data analytics  

## **How It Works**  
1. **YOLO-Based Object Detection**: The camera captures images of fruits on the conveyor belt and detects their type.  
2. **Freshness Classification**:  
   - A deep learning model predicts if the fruit is **fresh or rotten** based on visual characteristics.  
   - Sensors detect spoilage gases or check expiry tags (for packed products).  
3. **ROS-Based Processing**:  
   - The detected information is sent via ROS nodes to control the sorting mechanism.  
   - ROS ensures seamless communication between sensors, motors, and the detection system.  
4. **Motorized Sorting System**:  
   - If **fresh**, the motor moves the fruit to the **"Fresh"** section.  
   - If **rotten or expired**, the system diverts it to the **"Reject"** section.  
5. **Real-Time Monitoring & Data Logging** (Future Scope):  
   - IoT integration can enable cloud storage of detection results.  
   - Alerts and reports can be generated for quality control.
